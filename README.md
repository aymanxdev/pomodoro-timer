# Pomodoro Timer 🍅 

## What is Pomodoro Technique? 🎯
The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study.
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length,
separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato',
after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
